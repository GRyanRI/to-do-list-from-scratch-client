Welcome to my to-do list!

Using this app, users will be able to add tasks that they need to complete to a list. 
When users complete a task, it will be removed from their "to-do" list and added to their "completed tasks" list.
Users will be able to add the: Task name & a description of what they need to accomplish. Also, they will be able to edit the task whenever the it is neccessary.

For security purposes, in order to create a "to-do" list, users must: Create an account & login. Once logged-in, users will gain access to their personal list.

Remaining tasks for this project include:

1. Add to-do list section to html/css
2. Add task entry/edit system to html/css
3. Add completed tasks section to html/css
4. Add clear completed tasks option.
5. Style the site to make it more appealing.

Explanation:

Due to time restraints on this project, I had to trim the scope way down. The initial thoughts of creating a complete "planner," ended up transforming into creating a "to-do" list, with the intent of upgrading to a complete daily planner when I have sufficient time.
